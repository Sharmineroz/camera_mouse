This is a simple application to control the PCÂ´s cursor with hand gestures shown to a camera using python. The instructions to make it work are listed below:

1. Clone the repository and move where is located:
	`$ cd location/of/the/repository`
	
2. Install the required libraries (here I'm using anaconda):
	`$ conda  install -c conda-forge --file requiremensts.txt`

3. Run the camouse.py script:
	`python camouse.py`
	
	It will pop two windows stacked one over the other (please slide them to show both on the screen).

4. Set the slidebars to values so that you see in the black/white image above almost only your hand in white color. Then in the other window select your hand clicking and dragging the cursor to form a frame containing the hand (the same way as one draws a square in paint)

	Then by typng "q", it will pop an image showing wour selection, if correct, type "q" again, if not, type "z" to select again.

5. If everything went right it deploys a window similar to the image below. Showing a red dot over the hand and a blue grid for location purposes.

The cursor control works like a joystick, it moves the cursor only in the directions of the regions painted in green and one can only left or right click in the region painted in orange. Do a fist to right click and swearing gesture (all fingers together) to left click.

### Finaly, type "q" again to exit.
