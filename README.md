This is a simple application to control the PCÂ´s cursor with hand gestures shown to a camera using python. The instructions to make it work are listed below:

1. Clone the repository and move where is located:
	`$ cd location/of/the/repository`
	
2. Install the required libraries (here I'm using anaconda):
	`$ conda  install -c conda-forge --file requiremensts.txt`

3. Run the camouse.py script:
	`python camouse.py`
	
	It will pop two windows stacket one over the other (please slide them to show both on the screen).
